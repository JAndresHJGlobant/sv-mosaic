# Drawers
The `Drawers` component is wrapper that generates several [Material-UI Drawers](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/#main-content) but with SimpleView brand colors.

The component does not provide a mechanism for navigating between drawers, it only helps stacking one on top of another.
All the navgitation mechanism should be defined on the parent app creating the Drawers component.

## Props

https://github.com/simpleviewinc/sv-mosaic/blob/develop/src/components/Drawers/DrawersTypes.ts

## Usage
```ts
// We recommend placing the useForm hook at the top of your component.
const App = (props) => {
	//...rest of App.tsx
	const contentsArr = [
		<MyContent1 />,
		<MyContent2 />,
		...,
		<MyContentN />
	]

	return (
		<>
			//...rest of JSX code.
			<Drawers drawers={contentsArr} />
		</>
	);
}
```
